## Evaluation install

To quickly evaluate SMC on your own machine, you can **[run a Docker image](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/blob/master/src/dev/docker/README.md)**.

## History

*CoCalc* was formerly called *SageMathCloud*.
It started to offer way more than just SageMath and hence outgrew itself.
The name was coined in fall 2016 and changed around spring 2017.

The following instruction **don't** install SMC. They're for development purposes only!

   * `git clone https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc` -- copy repo
   * `cd cocalc/src`
   * `npm run install-all` -- build
   * `npm test` -- run test suite (expected failures if your clock is not UTC)
   * `install.py all --compute --web` -- build and install some parts system-wide for development use
   * See `INSTALL.md` for more details.
